# PISO_RTL

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a **Parallel-In, Serial-Out (PISO) Register**. A PISO register is a digital circuit that allows parallel data to be loaded into the register and then shifted out serially, one bit at a time. 
<br/> *Design Language: **Verilog***
<br/> *Design Tool: **Xilinx Vivado***
</br> *Applications of PISO:* ***Shift Registers, Serial Data Transmission, Memory Addressing, etc.***
